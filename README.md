# sabayon-tools
This is my Portage overlay, it was originally intended for Atom with ebuilds to install Atom from binary packages on Sabayon Linux. It has since been expanded to include extra packages and be intended for Funtoo Linux. To add this overlay run (as root):
```sh
layman -a sabayon-tools
```
`STATUS.md` files refer to my history (of past build/installation failures) with the ebuild in question.
