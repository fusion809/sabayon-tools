# sabayon-tools
This is my Sabayon overlay, it was originally intended for Atom with ebuilds to install Atom from binary packages. It has since been expanded to include extra packages. To add this overlay run (as root):
```sh
layman -a sabayon-tools
```
`STATUS.md` files refer to my history (of past build/installation failures) with the ebuild in question.
